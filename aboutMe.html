			<p>Hello, my name is Luis Covarrubias.I've been drawn to this field for many years because of the Computer Science classes I've taken throughout high school. Through taking these classes I've learned to code in many languages and strengthen my skills as a problem solver. With this page I will take you along my time as a student and present all that I have learned and hopefully show my progress better than just explaining it.</p>
