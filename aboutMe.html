			<p>Hello, my name is Luis Covarrubias, I&apos;m 21 years old, and I was born and raised in Houston, Texas.</br></br>
		
			From a young age I just knew I loved technology. From interacting with my first video game console to using my first computer, I knew I had to discover everything technology was capable of. This passion and curiosity motivated me to learn the ins-and-outs of every device or program I encountered. I wanted to understand how my computer worked, and this knowledge even allowed me to build my own computer. I also went on to learn how to navigate simple menus and settings that at first glance look intimidating to the average person. This easily led me to being the designated &quot;tech&quot; person within my household. Every issue my family presented me with, I would make sure I could provide a helpful solution no matter how difficult the problem was. I feel that this drive for solving any problem is what makes me the person I am today. When I had questions about technology, I resorted to sifting through numerous manuals, videos, and guides. Therefore, when the opportunity arises, I always strive to help others in any way I can with the knowledge I have gained. I hope one day I am able to take my knowledge to the next level by continually growing my skill set and teaching others based on my own experiences.</br></br>


			I&apos;ve been drawn to the programming field for many years mainly because of the Computer Science classes I took throughout my high school years and my Computer Science teacher, who always encouraged me to learn more about the field. It was from taking these classes that I&apos;ve learned to code in many languages, as seen on my main projects page, and strengthen my skills as a problem solver. In school, I learned many core programming concepts that I could use in all my work. Outside of school, I worked on many projects, all varying in sizes, that further strengthen my knowledge and understanding of the programming languages I know today.</br></br>

			Making this website was a lot of fun, not just because I could show off some of my HTML and CSS knowledge, but because I now can show anyone what I enjoy to do in an easily digestible format. I don&apos;t ever see this website being fully completed, I always want to make sure I update and show off more of what I&apos;m capable of.</p>
