			<p>Hello, my name is Luis Covarrubias, I&apos;m 21 years old, and I was born and raised in Houston, Texas.</br></br>
		
			From a young age I just knew I loved technology. Starting from interacting with my first video game console to using my first computer, I just knew that I had to see everything they could do. Anything I used, I always wanted to learn the ins-and-outs of it, like understanding how my computer works, and from this comprehension learning how to build my own computer or navigating simple menus and settings, that at first glance look intimidating, which led to me being the designated &quot;tech&quot; person within my household. Every issue my family presented me with, I would make sure I could provide a helpful solution no matter how difficult the problem was. I feel that this drive for solving any problem is what makes me the person I am today. I always want to help in any way possible because when I had questions I had to sift many help pages, videos, and guides. No one person was able to teach me these tools and skills so I wanted to just make sure I learned as much as possible and maybe one day teach others based on my experiences.</br></br>


			I&apos;ve been drawn to the programming field for many years mainly because of the Computer Science classes I took throughout my high school years and my Computer Science teacher, who always encouraged me to learn more about the field. It was from taking these classes that I&apos;ve learned to code in many languages, as seen on my main projects page, and strengthen my skills as a problem solver. In school, I learned many core programming concepts that I could use in all my work. Outside of school, I worked on many projects, all varying in sizes, that further strengthen my knowledge and understanding of the programming languages I know today.</br></br>

			Making this website was a lot of fun, not just because I could show off some of my HTML and CSS knowledge, but because I now can show anyone what I enjoy to do in an easily digestible format. I don&apos;t ever see this website being fully completed, I always want to make sure I update and show off more of what I&apos;m capable of.</p>
