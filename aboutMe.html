			<p>Hello, my name is Luis Covarrubias, I&apos;m 19 years old, and I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. </br></br>

			From a young age I just knew I loved technology and problem solving. Starting from Interacting with my first video game console to using my first computer, I just knew that I had to see everything they could do. Anything I used, I always wanted to make sure I learned the ins-and-outs of it, like understanding how my computer works to navigating simple menus and settings, which led to me being the designated &quot;tech&quot; person within my household. Every issue my family presented me with, I would make sure I could provide a helpful solution no matter how difficult the problem was. I feel that this drive for solving any problem is what makes me the person I am today. </br></br>

			I&apos;ve been drawn to the programming field for many years mainly because of the Computer Science classes I took throughout high school and my Computer Science teacher, who always encouraged me to learn more about the field. It was from taking these classes that I&apos;ve learned to code in many languages, as seen on the main page, and strengthen my skills as a problem solver.</br></br>

			Making this website was a lot of fun, not just because I could show off some of my HTML knowledge, but because I genuinely enjoy creating something from nothing and seeing </p>
