        <br><br><p>This is a website I made for my family with the intent of preserving the recipes that my mother knows, passed to her from other family members or that she learns from watching cooking shows or even Youtube videos. Clicking the logo will take you the website, feel free to look around, maybe make yourself something to eat.</p>

		<br><br><h2><b>9th Grade Portfolio</b></h2>
		<a href="https://codepen.io/luiscovarrubias/full/OJErPPx"><img src="9thGradeFinal.png" alt="9th Grade website"></a>
		<br><p>This website was made my freshmen year of high school as my year end final project. The website was to show everything I had learned during the time with spent HTML and CSS in some capacity while also showcasing some of the projects I made previously. The childish nature of it shows how much more different I am, things like my Playstation name or adding favorite sports teams are things I probably wouldn't add nowadays.</p>
