		<h2><u>About Me:</u></h2>
			<p><font face = "Times New Roman"  size = "4" >Hello, my name is Luis Covarrubias. I am currently a senior at Spring Woods Senior High School. I have been coding for 3 years, going on 4 years now. Some of the languages I've learned are Python, HTML, and Java. After I finish school, the career I would like to have is in App Development. Currently I am learning how code with Swift and the possible carrers I can go into with it.</font></p>

	<h2><b><u>My Computer Science Projects:</u></b></h2>
		<p>Below are some of my major projects that I've created and also serve a timeline through the different programming langueages I have learned throughout my time as a high school computer science student</p>


		<h3><b><u>Scratch:</u></b></h3>
			<p>My first step into the programming world was with Scratch, a very stripped down building blocks language that taught me the basics of coding and holds a special place in my heart.</br> The projects below show two different properties in science with molecule speed and the DNA bonding pairs repectfully<p>

		<h3><b><u>Processing:</u></b></h3>
			<p>The next major step on my journey was Processing. It is a simplifed version of Java and taught a lot about making classes, variables, objects, arrays, functions, and the other basics of an actual programming language.</p>
