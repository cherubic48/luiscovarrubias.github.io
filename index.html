		<h2><u>About Me:</u></h2>
			<p>Hello, my name is Luis Covarrubias. I've been drawn to this field for many years because of the Computer Science classes I've taken throughout high school. Through taking these classes I've learned to code in many languages and strengthen my skills as a problem solver. With this page I will take you along my time as a student and present all that I have learned and hopefully show my progress better than just explaining it.#fff9e8</p>

	<h2><b><u>My Computer Science Projects:</u></b></h2>
		<p>This is meant to showcase my projects in order from oldest to newest. This is an timeline through different programming languages I have learned throughout my time as a computer science student</p> 


		<h3><b><u>Scratch:</u></b></h3>
			<p>The first time I was exposed to programming was with program called Scratch. It's a very basic building blocks language that's meant to teach users the basics of programming. Many of my first projects were made on here before moving on to other languages</br></p>

		<h3><b><u>Processing:</u></b></h3>
			<p>The next major step on my journey was Processing. It is a simplifed version of Java and taught a lot about making classes, variables, objects, arrays, functions, and the other basics of an actual programming language.</p>
