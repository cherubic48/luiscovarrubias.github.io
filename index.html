		<h2><u>About Me:</u></h2>
			<p><font face = "Helvetica"  size = "4" >Hello, my name is Luis Covarrubias. I've been drawn to this field for many years because of the Computer Science classes I've taken throughout high school. Through taking these classes I've learned to code in many languages and strengthen my skills as a problem solver. With this page I will take you along my time as a student and present all that I have learned and hopefully show my progress better than just explaining it.</font></p>

		<h3><b><u>Scratch:</u></b></h3>
			<p>The first time I was exposed to programming was with program called Scratch. It's a very bare building blocks language thats meant to teach me the basics of programming. Many of my first projects were made on here before moving on to more complex ones</br></p>

		<h3><b><u>Processing:</u></b></h3>
			<p>The next major step on my journey was Processing. It is a simplifed version of Java and taught a lot about making classes, variables, objects, arrays, functions, and the other basics of an actual programming language.</p>
